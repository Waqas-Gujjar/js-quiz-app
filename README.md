## Customization
## Questions
You can customize the questions and answers by modifying the quizData array in `script.js`. Each question object contains:

. `question`: The question text.
. `a`, `b`, `c`,`d`: The answer options.
. `correct`: The correct answer's key.

## Example:
`const quizData = [
    {
        question: "Your question here?",
        a: "Option A",
        b: "Option B",
        c: "Option C",
        d: "Option D",
        correct: "b"
    }
    // More questions...
];`

## Styling
Adjust the styles in `style.css` to fit your design preferences. You can change colors, fonts, layouts, and more.

## Responsive Design
The Quiz App includes media queries in style.css to ensure it is responsive across different screen sizes:

1. Above 1200px: Standard layout.
2. 768px - 1200px: Adjusted layout for tablets.
3. 480px - 768px: Adjusted layout for small tablets and large smartphones.
4. Below 480px: Optimized for mobile devices.
# Future Improvements
1. Timed Quiz: Implement a timer for each question or the entire quiz.
2. Question Shuffling: Randomize the order of questions for each quiz session.
3. Enhanced Feedback: Provide feedback on each answer immediately after selection.
4. Persistent Scores: Store and display past scores using local storage or a backend service.
